In such cases, existing Lifetime Access users will be given:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advanced notice of at least 30 days before any changes take effect</li>
        <li>Options to either continue with the updated service or receive a partial refund based on the time elapsed since purchase</li>
    </ul>
